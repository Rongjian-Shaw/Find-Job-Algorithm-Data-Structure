Notice that sum of the coefficients are always constant, hence we want to find a distribution of ai obtainable such that S is minimum. To do so we perform cuts on highest cost edge as early as possible, which will reach to optimal S. If we encounter several edges having the same cost, we can cut any one of them first.\n",

    "** Naive approach ** is to generate all the permutation of array and pick the smallest one which satisfy the condition of at-most k swaps. Time complexity of this approach is Ω(n!), which will definitely time out for large value of n.\n",
    "\n",
    "An** Efficient** approach is to think greedily. We first pick the smallest element from array a1, a2, a3…(ak or an) [We consider ak when k is smaller, else n]. We place the smallest element to the a0 position after shifting all these elements by 1 position right. We subtract number of swaps (number of swaps is number of shifts minus 1) from k. If still we are left with k > 0 then we apply the same procedure from the very next starting position i.e., a2, a3,…(ak or an) and then place it to the a1 position. So we keep applying the same process until k becomes 0."
