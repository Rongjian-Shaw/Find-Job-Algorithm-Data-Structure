    "This problem can be solved using greedy approach, If total cost is denoted by S, then S = a1w1 + a2w2 … + akwk, where wi is a cost of certain edge cutting and ai is corresponding coefficient, The coefficient ai is determined by the total number of cuts we have competed using edge wi at the end of the cutting process. Notice that sum of the coefficients are always constant, hence we want to find a distribution of ai obtainable such that S is minimum. To do so we perform cuts on highest cost edge as early as possible, which will reach to optimal S. If we encounter several edges having the same cost, we can cut any one of them first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the solution using above approach, first we sorted the edge cutting costs in reverse order, then we loop in them from higher cost to lower cost building our solution. Each time we choose an edge, counter part count is incremented by 1, which is to be multiplied each time with corresponding edge cutting cost."

We place the smallest element to the a0 position after shifting all these elements by 1 position right. We subtract number of swaps (number of swaps is number of shifts minus 1) from k. If still we are left with k > 0 then we apply the same procedure from the very next starting position i.e., a2, a3,…(ak or an) and then place it to the a1 position. So we keep applying the same process until k becomes 0."
